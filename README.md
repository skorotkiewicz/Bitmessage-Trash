Bitmessage Trash
=========

This is a simple program written in Python to remove and read messages from the trash

  - You can read messages from the trash
  - You can completely delete messages from trash
  - This is a version written in one night,anyone can add or change something, just let me know about changes, maybe I'll like :)


What inspired me to create this program? 
No trash and message file occupies _more space_ on disk!
